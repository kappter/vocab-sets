Term,Definition
Add fractions with unlike denominators,"To add fractions, make the bottoms (denominators) the same, then add the tops."
Multiply decimals,"Ignore the decimal point, multiply like whole numbers, then count how many digits were after the decimal."
Solve 2x + 3 = 11,"First subtract 3 from both sides, then divide by 2 to get x by itself."
Graph a linear equation,"Pick x-values, plug them in to get y-values, then plot the (x, y) points."
Order of operations: 3 + 6 × (5 + 4) ÷ 3 - 7,"Do what's in parentheses first, then multiplication/division, then add/subtract."
