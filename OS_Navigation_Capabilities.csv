System: It looks like the previous response was cut off. I'll complete the CSV file with 50-75 operating system navigation techniques, practical capabilities, and styles, ensuring each entry includes a term, definition, and skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). The content will cover a broad range of skills across operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, emphasizing both GUI and command-line techniques to encourage learning new concepts. The CSV will be wrapped in an artifact tag with a new UUID, as this is a distinct artifact from the guitar techniques CSV.
