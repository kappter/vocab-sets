Term,Definition
Polymorphism,"The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling method overriding or overloading."
Encapsulation,"The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of an object's components."
Recursion,A process where a function calls itself as a subroutine to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller instances of the same problem.
Linked List,"A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked to the next by pointers."
Binary Search Tree,"A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, used for efficient searching and sorting."
Dynamic Programming,An optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results.
Interface,"A abstract type that defines a contract of methods that a class must implement, without specifying how."
Hash Table,"A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, using a hash function to compute an index."
Big-O Notation,A mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space complexity.

Combo Box,"A GUI control that combines a dropdown list with a text field, allowing users to select or type a value."
Radio Button,A GUI control that allows users to select one option from a set of mutually exclusive choices.
Button,"A GUI control that triggers an action when clicked, such as submitting a form or starting a process."
Date Selector,"A GUI control that enables users to select a date from a calendar interface, often used in forms."
Check Box,"A GUI control that allows users to toggle a boolean option, often used for multiple selections."
Label,"A GUI control that displays static text or descriptions, often used to identify other controls."
Slider,A GUI control that lets users select a value from a range by dragging a handle along a track.
Spinner,A GUI control that allows users to increment or decrement a numeric value using up/down arrows.
Toggle Button,"A GUI control that switches between two states (e.g., on/off) when clicked."
Abstract Class,"A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods, used as a blueprint for subclasses."
Abstract Method,"A method declared in an abstract class or interface without an implementation, requiring subclasses to provide one."
Concrete Class,A class that fully implements all inherited abstract methods and can be instantiated.
Superclass,A parent class from which other classes inherit properties and methods.
Subclass,"A class that inherits properties and methods from a superclass, extending or modifying its behavior."
Package,"A namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces, helping to manage large codebases."
Access Modifier,"A keyword (e.g., public, private, protected) that specifies the accessibility of a class, method, or variable."
extends Keyword,A Java keyword used to establish an inheritance relationship between a subclass and its superclass.
implements Keyword,A Java keyword used to declare that a class will provide implementations for an interface's methods.
Enhanced For Loop,A simplified for loop syntax used to iterate over arrays or collections without needing an index variable.
For-Each Loop,"Another name for the enhanced for loop, commonly used to traverse elements in a collection or array."
Ternary Operator,A shorthand conditional operator (?:) that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on the result.
Conditional Expression,An expression using the ternary operator to provide a concise alternative to an if-else statement.
Method Overloading,Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.
Method Overriding,"Redefining a method in a subclass to provide a specific implementation, replacing the superclass's version."
super Keyword,A keyword used to call a superclass's method or constructor from a subclass.
Multidimensional Array,"An array of arrays, often used to represent matrices or grids, such as a 2D array."
2D Array,"A multidimensional array with two dimensions, typically used to store data in rows and columns."
Jagged Array,A multidimensional array where each row can have a different number of columns.
File Input/Output,The process of reading from and writing to files using streams or file handling classes.
BufferedReader,"A Java class used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters to reduce direct access to the underlying system."
FileWriter,"A Java class used to write character data to a file, often used with buffering for efficiency."
Try-Catch Block,A construct used to handle exceptions by attempting risky code and catching errors if they occur.
Checked Exception,"An exception that must be declared or handled, typically related to external resources like files or networks."
Unchecked Exception,"An exception that does not need to be declared or handled, typically caused by programming errors (e.g., NullPointerException)."
Recursive Base Case,"The condition in a recursive function that stops the recursion, preventing infinite loops."
Recursive Step,The part of a recursive function where it calls itself with a smaller input to approach the base case.
QuickSort,A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively sorts subarrays.
MergeSort,"A stable sorting algorithm that divides an array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results."
Binary Search,A search algorithm that finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Filter Method,"A method (e.g., in Java streams) that selects elements from a collection based on a given condition."
Binary Tree,"A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as left and right."
Inorder Traversal,"A binary tree traversal method that visits the left subtree, the root, and then the right subtree."
Leaf Node,A node in a binary tree that has no children.
ArrayList,"A resizable array implementation of the List interface in Java, part of the Collections framework."
