Term,Definition
Aperture,The opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the camera, measured in f-stops (e.g., f/2.8).
Shutter Speed,The amount of time the camera's shutter is open, controlling light exposure and motion blur (e.g., 1/250 sec).
ISO,The camera sensor's sensitivity to light; higher ISO values increase brightness but may add noise.
DSLR,Digital Single-Lens Reflex camera, using a mirror and prism to show the exact image through the lens.
Lens Focal Length,The distance (in mm) between the lens and the sensor, affecting the angle of view and magnification.
Prime Lens,A lens with a fixed focal length (e.g., 50mm), often sharper and faster than zoom lenses.
Zoom Lens,A lens with a variable focal length (e.g., 18-55mm), allowing flexible framing without moving.
Depth of Field,The range of distance in an image that appears sharp, controlled by aperture, lens, and distance.
Bokeh,The aesthetic quality of the out-of-focus areas in an image, often with soft, circular light spots.
White Balance,Adjusting the camera to correct color casts caused by different light sources (e.g., sunlight, tungsten).
Exposure,The amount of light reaching the sensor, determined by aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
Overexposure,When an image is too bright due to excessive light hitting the sensor.
Underexposure,When an image is too dark due to insufficient light hitting the sensor.
Histogram,A graph showing the distribution of light and dark tones in an image, used to check exposure.
RAW,A file format that captures unprocessed sensor data, allowing greater editing flexibility.
JPEG,A compressed image file format that processes colors and tones, smaller than RAW but less editable.
Autofocus,The camera's ability to automatically focus on a subject using focus points or tracking.
Manual Focus,Manually adjusting the lens to achieve sharp focus, useful in low light or for creative control.
Focus Point,A specific area in the viewfinder where the camera focuses, selectable in many DSLRs.
Shutter Priority,A shooting mode (S or Tv) where the photographer sets the shutter speed, and the camera adjusts aperture.
Aperture Priority,A shooting mode (A or Av) where the photographer sets the aperture, and the camera adjusts shutter speed.
Manual Mode,A shooting mode (M) where the photographer controls both aperture and shutter speed.
Exposure Compensation,Adjusting exposure in auto modes to make images brighter or darker (e.g., +1 or -1 stops).
Metering,The camera's method of measuring light to determine exposure (e.g., evaluative, spot, center-weighted).
Rule of Thirds,A composition guideline dividing the frame into a 3x3 grid, placing subjects along lines or intersections.
Leading Lines,Lines in an image (e.g., roads, fences) that guide the viewer's eye toward the subject.
Framing,Using elements like windows or arches to enclose the subject, adding context or focus.
Symmetry,Composing an image with balanced elements mirrored across a central axis for visual harmony.
Golden Ratio,A compositional proportion (approximately 1:1.618) creating a natural, pleasing balance.
Foreground,The part of the image closest to the camera, adding depth or context to the composition.
Background,The area behind the subject, which can be blurred or detailed to enhance the image.
Perspective,The angle or viewpoint from which a photo is taken, affecting how subjects appear (e.g., low-angle shots).
Wide-Angle Lens,A lens with a short focal length (e.g., 10-35mm), capturing a broad field of view, ideal for landscapes.
Telephoto Lens,A lens with a long focal length (e.g., 70-200mm), magnifying distant subjects, ideal for portraits or wildlife.
Macro Photography,Close-up photography of small subjects (e.g., insects, flowers), showing fine details.
Portrait Photography,Photography focused on capturing a person's expression, personality, or mood.
Landscape Photography,Photography capturing natural scenery, often with wide-angle lenses for expansive views.
Street Photography,Candid photography of everyday life in public spaces, capturing spontaneous moments.
Panning,A technique where the camera follows a moving subject with a slow shutter speed, blurring the background.
Long Exposure,A technique using a slow shutter speed to capture motion blur or light trails (e.g., waterfalls, starry skies).
Fill Light,A secondary light source used to brighten shadows without overpowering the main light.
Key Light,The primary light source in a scene, defining the subject's illumination and mood.
Backlighting,Light coming from behind the subject, creating silhouettes or glowing effects like halos.
Soft Light,Diffused light that reduces harsh shadows, often from overcast skies or softboxes.
Hard Light,Direct light creating sharp, defined shadows, often from the sun or a bare bulb.
Golden Hour,The period shortly after sunrise or before sunset, providing warm, soft light for photography.
Blue Hour,The twilight period before sunrise or after sunset, with cool, blue-toned light.
Diffuser,A tool (e.g., fabric, umbrella) that softens light by spreading it, reducing harsh shadows.
Reflector,A tool that bounces light onto a subject to fill shadows or highlight features.
Flash,A device that emits a burst of light to illuminate a scene, often built into or attached to DSLRs.
High-Key Lighting,Bright, even lighting with minimal shadows, often used for cheerful or airy images.
Low-Key Lighting,Dark, dramatic lighting with strong shadows, emphasizing mood or contrast.
Chiaroscuro,A lighting technique using strong contrasts between light and dark for dramatic effect.
Silhouette,A subject photographed against a bright background, appearing dark with no visible details.
Bracketing,Taking multiple shots at different exposures to ensure one is correctly exposed or for HDR.
HDR,High Dynamic Range imaging, combining multiple exposures to capture details in both shadows and highlights.
Viewfinder,The eyepiece or screen showing what the lens sees, used for composing and focusing.
Tripod,A three-legged stand that stabilizes the camera, essential for long exposures or low light.
Lens Hood,A device attached to the lens to block stray light, reducing flare and improving contrast.
ND Filter,Neutral Density filter, reduces light entering the lens for long exposures or wide apertures in bright conditions.
Polarizing Filter,A filter that reduces reflections and glare, enhancing colors and contrast in skies or water.
Dynamic Range,The range of light intensities a camera can capture, from darkest shadows to brightest highlights.
