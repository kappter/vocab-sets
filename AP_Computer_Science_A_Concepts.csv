Two-Dimensional Array,"An array of arrays, used to represent data in a grid or matrix."
ArrayList,"A resizable array in Java’s `java.util` package that can dynamically grow or shrink."
Class,"A blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties (fields) and behaviors (methods)."
Object,"An instance of a class, created using the `new` keyword."
Constructor,"A special method in a class used to initialize objects, with the same name as the class."

Void Method,"A method that does not return a value, declared with the `void` keyword."
Static Method,"A method belonging to a class rather than an instance, called without creating an object."
Instance Variable,"A variable defined in a class, unique to each object of that class."
Local Variable,"A variable declared within a method or block, only accessible within that scope."
Scope,"The region of a program where a variable is accessible, determined by where it is declared."
Encapsulation,"Hiding a class’s data (fields) and providing access via public methods (getters and setters)."
Inheritance,"A mechanism where a subclass inherits fields and methods from a superclass."
Polymorphism,"The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass."
Method Overriding,"A subclass providing a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass."
Method Overloading,"Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists in the same class."
Super Keyword,"Used to refer to the superclass’s constructor, methods, or fields from a subclass."
This Keyword,"Used to refer to the current object’s fields or methods, or to call another constructor."
Access Modifier,"Keywords like `public`, `private`, `protected` that control access to class members."
Public Access,"An access modifier allowing unrestricted access to a class, field, or method."
Private Access,"An access modifier restricting access to within the same class."
String Class,"A Java class for immutable sequences of characters, with methods like `length()` and `substring()`."
Math Class,"A Java class with static methods for mathematical operations (e.g., `Math.abs()`, `Math.pow()`)."
Random Class,"A Java class in `java.util` for generating pseudorandom numbers."
Boolean Expression,"An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`, used in control structures."
Conditional Statement,"A statement like `if`, `else`, or `switch` that controls program flow based on conditions."
Loop Control Variable,"A variable used to control the number of iterations in a loop, often in a `for` loop."
Index Out of Bounds,"An error occurring when accessing an array or ArrayList with an invalid index."
Null Pointer Exception,"An error occurring when trying to access a method or field of a null object reference."
